# QuantumJourney
Journey of mine into quantum computing.

Steps:
1. Complex number object creation. Just redefined addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for complex numbers. Also gave them a conjugate and modulus field for ease of use.
2. More complex number work, such as converting cartesian to polar.


Special note: complex object can be considered a basic vector.
